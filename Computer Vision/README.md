### Description
### Background and Context
Can we differentiate a weed from a crop seedling? The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment. The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages

### Objective
To implement the techniques learnt in Computer Vision.

### Data Description
We are provided with a datasetof images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo

### Data Dictionary
The dataset can be download from Olympus.

The data file names are:

* images.npy
* Label.csv
